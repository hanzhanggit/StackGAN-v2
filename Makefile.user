# This is an Makefile where extra targets can be defined by users. If the file
# exists beside the main `Makefile` it will be included after all other targets.
# Users can define custom targets this way.
#
# NOTE: You do _not_ have to copy this file; if you don't need any extra targets,
#       just ignore it! It is there to add user defined functionality to the
#       default set.
